  <h2>Simple Ceremony Is Held for French Nobel Prize Author</h2>
  <p>Paris, Jan. 6—Albert Camus, one of France’s ranking writers and winner of a Nobel Prize for Literature, was buried today in a cemetery not far from the country home he recently bought in the village of Lourmarin in the south of France.</p>
  <p>I was while monitoring from Lourmarin to Paris last Monday that the Algerian-born writer was killed when the car he was in went out of control and crashed into a tree at the side of highway, seventy-five miles southeast of Paris.</p>
